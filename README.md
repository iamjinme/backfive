# BackFive Boilerplate

Lightweight framework (less than 800kB) focused on simplicity, performance and compatibility with PHP since 5.3 version.
BackFive Boilerplate has [Slim2](https://www.slimframework.com/docs/v2/index.html), [Plates3](http://platesphp.com/v3/), [Paris Active Record](https://github.com/j4mie/paris) and [Bulma CSS framework](https://bulma.io/).

## Installation

Use [Git](https://git-scm.com/) to clone the repository.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/mirabalj/backfive.git your-project
```

This will create the boilerplate with all required dependencies. BackFive requires PHP 5.3.0 or newer.

## Usage

You may quickly test this using the built-in PHP server:
```bash
$ cd your-project
$ php -S localhost:8000
```

Going to http://localhost:8000/hello/world will now display "Hello, world" with template made with a CSS framework.
